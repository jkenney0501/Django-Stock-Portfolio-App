This application is designed to return stock name and pricing information when a user enters a ticker symbol 
in the search function. Additionally, the "add stock" link in the navigation bar will utilize a database function 
to store the ticker symbols when requested as a way of developing a personal portfolio.

The “Manage Portfolio” link is a page designed to show the tickers in the user’s portfolio and allows them to delete them 
individually as the investment strategy changes over time. Overall, the goal was to utilize an API to get stock information 
and allow the application to also utilize a database for this information.
